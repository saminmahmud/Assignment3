    <h4>SERVED EVERY DAY SINCE 1990</h4>
    <p>Bubby’s opened on Thanksgiving Day 1990. Chef / Owner Ron Silver began baking pies and selling them to restaurants and his neighbors out of a small kitchen at the corner of Hudson and North Moore St. in Tribeca. Today, NYC’s beloved restaurant and pie shop celebrates 27 years of classic, made from scratch American cooking.</p>
